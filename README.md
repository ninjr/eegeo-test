# Purpose

The purpose of lonely.js is to determine the greatest distance from a collection of points.

This script will work with any file that is fomatted as such.
 - Each place should be on a new line
 - Each place's variable should be separated by a single space
 - Current accepted format ` placeName pointX pointY`

## Running The Script
`node and npm must be installed prior to running this script`
```sh
$ npm install
$ node lonely.js ./input_file.txt
```

## Further Consideration
This script has basic functionality, and hence isn't as efficient as I would like. There would be definate speed increases if I utilised different sorting methods.
